# mac--Battery-Percentage-AlertPrompt

This shortcut will run in the background once activated. It will detect if your Mac is charging within 15 minutes based on an increase in battery percentage. You can program it to perform any action. For instance, I have programmed it to notify me to charge my laptop when the battery percentage drops below 25% (Battery Level) and to remove the charging adapter when the battery percentage exceeds 75% (Charging Level).

You can adjust the wait time to anything between 5 and 20 minutes for optimal resource consumption.
